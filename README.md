# Music_Store_Analysis

## Overview
This project focuses on analyzing the data of an online music store's database using SQL. The dataset provides insights into the store's music album, employees, customer details, invoice details, and sales trends. By querying the database, we can address various business-related questions and assist the store in understanding its growth.

** I connected Postgre SQL database with Jupyter Notebook for better queries and results insights **

## Project Structure
The project is organized as follows:

**SQL Queries and Results:** The Jupyter notebook contains the SQL queries used to analyze the dataset. Each query is named according to the question it addresses, and following them provides the results of the queries along with explanations and interpretations.

**Schema:** Includes the structured schema of the database used.

**Database:** Includes the database used for analysis in a downloadable format.

**README.md:** The file you are currently reading, offering an overview of the project, its structure, and instructions for running the queries.
